This file will be given the 12th April
It gives the distribution of the training and testing set, 
and the annotation for each click : its Id, X, Y, Z in meter, the origin is the
hydrophone, and the range of the whale in meter (=norm(X,Y,Z)).
We also precise the quality of the annotation (=residual of the computation of
the position of the whale based on 4 hydrophones antenna (see ICASSP paper 2019),
that can be used for weighting samples in the training.

Note that the row of the matrix are in random order ( = clicks(rando) ), as the
task is not a tracking task, but range estimation on each individual click based
on its multipulsed temporal structure.
